//// Table of contents view: renders a 3-level nested `<ul>` of heading links
//// in the `.right-content` sidebar, mirroring apollo's
//// `templates/partials/toc.html`.
////
//// Active highlighting is driven declaratively from the model: the
//// IntersectionObserver effect (see `effect/toc.gleam`) dispatches
//// `TocActiveHeadingChanged(id)` messages, the model stores the active
//// heading id, and this view applies the `.selected` / `.parent` classes by
//// comparing each entry's id to the active one. This is the idiomatic
//// Lustre/Elm-architecture approach — no direct DOM class manipulation.
////
//// The TOC is hidden below 1365px viewport (via the `.toc` CSS rule ported
//// from apollo).
