//// Table-of-contents effect: sets up an IntersectionObserver over the
//// rendered post body and dispatches the active heading's id as a `String`,
//// which the caller maps into a `Msg` via `effect.map`.
////
//// Mirrors apollo's `static/js/toc.js` behaviour, but uses the idiomatic
//// Lustre approach: side effects are data (an `Effect(Msg)`), and the
//// observer calls `dispatch` to feed results back into `update` rather than
//// manipulating DOM classes directly. The `view/toc.gleam` module then
//// applies `.selected` / `.parent` classes declaratively from the model.
////
//// The FFI lives in `src/ffi/observer.ffi.mjs`. The `@external` declaration
//// has a no-op Gleam fallback body so the project still builds when targeting
//// Erlang (the observer only runs in the browser).
