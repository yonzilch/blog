//// Runtime syntax-highlighting effect.
////
//// Markdown code blocks are rendered at build time by mork and stored as plain
//// `<pre><code>` HTML in `content_index.json`. This effect enhances those
//// blocks after Lustre mounts the rendered content.
////
//// The JavaScript implementation:
////
////   - skips loading the runtime when highlighting is disabled
////   - skips loading when no eligible code blocks exist
////   - loads the configured Highlight.js browser bundle at most once
////   - highlights newly mounted code blocks after SPA navigation
////   - leaves Mermaid and plain-text blocks untouched
////   - fails open when the runtime cannot be loaded
////
//// The configured URL must point to a browser-compatible Highlight.js bundle
//// that exposes `globalThis.hljs`, such as the prebuilt `highlight.min.js`
//// distributed by Highlight.js.
////
//// Syntax highlighting and code-block controls are separate enhancements.
//// This effect tokenizes source code, while `effect/codeblock.gleam` adds copy
//// buttons, language labels, and horizontal-scroll behavior.
